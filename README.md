# Loan-Eligibility-Prediction-Model

Completed Loan Eligibility Prediction model using Python. A mechanism called the Loan Prediction System allows you to apply for loans and receive notifications when they are approved. By the data provided by the applicant, the system notifies the applicant of the loan's availability. Implemented popular Machine Learning Algorithms and explored numerous Python Libraries. Following pointers were showcased in this Loan Eligibility Tutorial project: 

* Supervised Learning Algorithms
* Algorithms For Loan Eligibility Prediction Project
* Decision Tree Algorithm
* Naive Bayes Theorem & Naive Bayes Classification
* Python Libraries (NumPy, Pandas, Scikit learn, Matplotlib)
* Project Implementation
